# Same syntax as .gitignore — one glob per line, # for comments.

# Files listed here are excluded from all ship-safe scans.
# Use this to suppress known false positives in your project.

# The pattern definition file contains pattern strings in description text.
# It is scanned and maintained by the ship-safe team — safe to exclude.
